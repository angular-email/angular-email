## Introduction

A collection of high-quality, unstyled components for creating beautiful emails using Angular and TypeScript.
It reduces the pain of coding responsive emails with dark mode support. It also takes care of inconsistencies between Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients for you.

## Why

Email is still a vital communication channel, but it's overdue for a fresh approach. We're done with the old methods from a decade ago—it's time to reimagine what email can be for 2022 and beyond. Email creation needs a transformation. A reinvention. Built to match the modern standards of web development today.

## Install


#### With yarn

```sh
yarn add @angular-email/angular-email
```

#### With npm

```sh
npm install @angular-email/angular-email
```


This will initialize all packages in parallel and watch for changes, including the website which will be available at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
